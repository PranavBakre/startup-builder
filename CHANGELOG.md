### Design

- **Project documentation structure established** — Created CLAUDE.md (project entry point), docs/documentation-guide.md (doc system conventions), docs/version-roadmap.md (v0.1–v1.0 breakdown), and CHANGELOG.md. The full game brief has been decomposed into 10 incremental sub-versions, each with scope, iteration 0, and acceptance criteria. @features documentation-setup
  - Files changed: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/documentation-guide.md`, `docs/version-roadmap.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
